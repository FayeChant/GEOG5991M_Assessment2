Instructions
============

**Setup**
---------

1. Save the following files, for example to "C:\\GEOG5991M\\Stereoheighting":

* SHPrep.py.
* Stereoheighting.py.
* Stereoframework.pyc
* Graphics.py.
* SHPrep.bat

2. Save the test data to for example "C:\\GEOG5991M\\Stereoheighting\\Testdata".

 
3. Open Stereoheighting.py and edit the defaults at lines 48 and 52 as appropriate:

* Line 48 - Default working directory if none entered by user at command prompt.
* Line 52 - Default input obstructions File if none entered by user at command prompt.

4. Open Graphics.py and edit the default at lines 28:

* Line 28 - Default working directory if none entered by user at command prompt.

The above is important if running through the batch file, as the prompts for folder/file inputs wont work and the module will use the above defaults. This means you could store the module files in one place, e.g. "C:\\Stereoheighting\\SHPrep". You would then just edit the defaults each time you run  the module for a new project, e.g working directory = C:\\Stereoheighting\\Project1, file = Obstructions.shp.
 
4. Create a folder in your working directory called "OUT". Within this folder, create a folder called "Cells".

**Running**
-----------

*This module can be run in different ways.*

To run this as a bat file.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Edit the SHPrep.bat file:

* Ensure the first part on both lines is the correct location of your python install for ArcGIS. e.g. C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.4\\python.exe.
* Change the location after the ">" to your working directory, or delete this part if you dont want a messages file retained. 

2. Double click the .bat file to run.

To Run this on command prompt
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Open command prompt from wherever you saved the python scripts.
2. Type "C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.4\python.exe SHprep.py" - NOTE: the first part must correspond to the correct location of your python install for ArcGIS. This will display any messages to the command prompt. Typing C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.4\\python.exe SHprep.py > "Root path"\\OUT\SHPmessages.txt will pipe messages to a text file.

* Enter working directory including quotes e.g. "C:\\GEOG5991M\\Stereoheighting"
* Enter obstructions points file including quotes e.g. "OBSTRUCTIONS.shp"
* Note - for either of the above - if you just type '#' (including the single quotes)- the defaults previously set will apply.

3. Type "C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.4\python.exe Graphics.py" - NOTE: the first part must correspond to the correct location of your python install for ArcGIS. This will display any messages to the command prompt.  Typing C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.4\\python.exe Graphics.py > "Root ptah"\\OUT\GPHmessages.txt will pipe messages to a text file.

* Enter working directory including quotes e.g. "C:\\GEOG5991M\\Stereoheighting"
* Note - for the above - if you just type '#' (including the single quotes)- the defaults previously set will apply.

To Run as a tool in ArcMap
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Open ArcMap
2. Open your obstruction file.
3. Click on ArcToolbox
4. Add a new toolbox, select the TT5 toolbox.
5. Within the TT5 toolbox, double click the 'SHPrep' script.

* Enter the workspace name.
* Enter the Obstruction file name.

6. Once this has successfully run, run Graphics.py. Currently the Graphics script will not work in ArcMap as it cant find the Geopandas Librabry. Please run this tool, for example in Spyder.

* Enter the workspace name e.g. C:\\GEOG5991M\\Stereoheighting. This will automatically find the required outputs from SHPrep.py.
